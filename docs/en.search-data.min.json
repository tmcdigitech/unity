To do this we need to define a function called draw(), which Pygame Zero will call every time it needs to redraw the screen:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  import pgzrun WIDTH = 800 HEIGHT = 600 def draw(): screen.fill((128, 0, 0)) pgzrun.go() # Must be last line   Why the double brackets?\nNotice that we had to use two sets of brackets in that example to set the colour of the background. In Pygame Zero, colours are always written as a set of three numbers like this: (0, 130, 255), which in Python is called a tuple (rhyming with \u0026lsquo;couple\u0026rsquo;). A tuple is indicated with round brackets. But the function also takes a set of round brackets, so we know it is a function. So the outer set of brackets belongs to the fill() function call, and the inside set to the tuple for the colour.  Basic shapes    Let\u0026rsquo;s add a couple of basic shapes.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  import pgzrun WIDTH = 800 HEIGHT = 600 def draw(): screen.fill((128, 0, 0)) screen.draw.filled_circle((0,150), 10, (200, 100, 200))  pgzrun.go() # Must be last line   The filled_circle() command takes three bits of information, known as arguments:\n the co-ordinates of the circle\u0026rsquo;s centre (x, y) as a tuple, the radius, the colour (r, g, b) as a tuple.
