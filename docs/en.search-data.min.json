All of your Gemma programs will start with one or more of these import lines.\nLine 5 gives us a reference to the pin that the built-in LED (the red one) is connected to. We store that reference in a variable called led. Line 6 tells the Gemma that we want to use the pin we\u0026rsquo;ve called led as an output (to drive the red LED).\nLines 8-12 are an infinite loop. We turn the LED on, wait for half a second, turn it off, and wait another half second.

Dotstars and Neopixels are designed to be chained together on a strip with common wires, so dot actually refers to a list of LEDs, not just one. Counting in computers usually begins at zero, so the LED at the end closest to the signal source is numbered dot[0] and the others numbered dot[1], dot[2] and so on. Since there is only one built-in dotstar, we only use dot[0].\nRespond to the capacitive input    You can use pin A2 as a capacitive input, meaning it will detect your finger touching it.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  import board import digitalio from touchio import TouchIn touch2 = TouchIn(board.A2) led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D13) led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT while True: led.value = touch2.value   Capacitive input and the RGB LED    If we want to control the RGB led with with the touch input, we need to do a bit more work, and use an if statement.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  import board import adafruit_dotstar as dotstar from touchio import TouchIn touch2 = TouchIn(board.A2) dot = dotstar.DotStar(board.APA102_SCK, board.APA102_MOSI, 1, brightness=0.2) while True: if touch2.value: dot[0] = (255, 255, 0) else: dot[0] = (0, 0, 255)   "},{"id":1,"href":"/gemma/01gettingStarted/","title":"Getting started","parent":"7 DigiTech","content":""},{"id":2,"href":"/gemma/02basics/counters/","title":"Counters","parent":"Learning the basics","content":"Embedded code like on a Gemma or Micro:bit often involves going around a main loop forever.
