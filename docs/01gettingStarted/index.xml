      <description>To develop games using Pygame Zero, you have two main options:
 use Mu use another editor  Mu is set up to be very helpful for beginners. It has some keyboard shortcuts, good help text, nice shortcut buttons, and is generaly very friendly to use and has a lot of features to help beginners get started.

      <description>Each of your projects should live in its own folder somewhere sensible (like in a Digital Tech folder in your OneDrive!).
project/ ├── game.py │ ├── images/ │ ├── someImage.jpg │ ├── anotherImage.jpg │ └── ... # sprites, tiles and other image files │ ├── fonts/ │ └── ... # any font files │ ├── sounds/ │ └── ... # any sound files │ └── music/ └── ... # any music files You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have those folders unless you have something to put in them.</description>
