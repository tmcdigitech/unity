      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get a simple game happening, a bit at a time, so you can see how you might go about it yourself.
All of these examples are complete programs, so make sure you copy them into Mu (or whatever editor you&amp;rsquo;re using) and run them as you go through this page.
Screen size    Let&amp;rsquo;s start by setting the size of the screen.
1 2 3 4 5 6  import pgzrun WIDTH = 800 HEIGHT = 600 pgzrun.</description>

      <description>When calling a function, the values given to it are called arguments. For example, in this case:
total = add(3, 4) 3 and 4 are arguments to the function add().
When defining a function, the pieces of information that the function takes to do its job are called parameters.</description>

      <title>co-ordinate system</title>

      <guid>https://digitech.nfshost.com/pgz/glossary/coordinate/</guid>
      <description>In most programming environments (such as Pygame Zero), the screen co-ordinate system uses (x, y) co-ordinates, with the origin (0, 0) in the top left corner of the screen, with x to the right, and y going down.
Everything to be displayed on the screen must be rastered, which means rendered into a grid of colored pixels.</description>

      <guid>https://digitech.nfshost.com/pgz/glossary/color/</guid>
      <description>In almost all programming, American spellings are used. So as programmers we use colors, even though we would normally spell the word colours.
For most programming, colors are described by the amount of red, green, and blue light to emit. These numbers are normally in the range 0-255. In Pygame Zero, we list these as a tuple (red, green, blue), such as:
(0, 150, 255) You can use the Google Color Picker to find different colors, and then copy the RGB value listed.</description>

      <description>When defining a function, the pieces of information that the function takes to do its job are called parameters. For example, here:
def add(first, second): return first + second first and second are the parameters of the function add().
When calling a function, the values given to it are called arguments.</description>

      <description>To develop games using Pygame Zero, you have two main options:
 use Mu use another editor  Mu is set up to be very helpful for beginners. It has some keyboard shortcuts, good help text, nice shortcut buttons, and is generaly very friendly to use and has a lot of features to help beginners get started.
After you have been writing code for a while, you may find that a standard Python environment and a &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; text editor like Visual Studio Code allows you a lot more power and flexibility, at the cost of doing some more basic things yourself.</description>

      <description>Each of your projects should live in its own folder somewhere sensible (like in a Digital Tech folder in your OneDrive!).
project/├── game.py│├── images/│ ├── someImage.jpg│ ├── anotherImage.jpg│ └── ... # sprites, tiles and other image files│├── fonts/│ └── ... # any font files│├── sounds/│ └── ... # any sound files│└── music/└── ... # any music filesYou don&amp;rsquo;t need to include those folders unless you have something to put in them.</description>

      <description>A tuple is a single unit of data made up of multiple values. In Python they are defined using round brackets, with commas separating the values. Tuples can contain all sorts of data as values, but in Pygame Zero we use them most often for colors (red, green, blue) and co-ordinates (x, y).</description>

      <description>Here is a checklist of things to look for if something is wrong&amp;hellip;
Spelling and Capitalisation    Remember that the computer is really, really, really, really stupid. It will recognise only words it has been taught; it is not clever enough to handle spelling mistakes - these will confuse it. It is also not clever enough to know that most of the time we use A and a interchangeably, so you have to make sure that if the computer is expecting a capital letter, you give it one, and vice versa.</description>
