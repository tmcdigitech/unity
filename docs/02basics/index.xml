All of these examples are complete programs, so make sure you copy them into Mu (or whatever editor you&amp;rsquo;re using) and run them as you go through this page.

      <description>Embedded code like on a Gemma or Micro:bit often involves going around a main loop forever. We can&amp;rsquo;t use sleep/wait/delay functions because they&amp;rsquo;ll stop everything else from happening. We can use counters to make multiple actions seem to happen at once.
Here is an example. In this case, you can see in the flowchart below that we will use a counter called n, and initialise it to 0. Each time around the loop we will check if n has reached 1000 yet.</description>
