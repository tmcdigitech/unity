      <description>When calling a function, the values given to it are called arguments. For example, in this case:
total = add(3, 4) 3 and 4 are arguments to the function add().
When defining a function, the pieces of information that the function takes to do its job are called parameters.</description>

      <description>In almost all programming, American spellings are used. So as programmers we use colors, even though we would normally spell the word colours.
Colors are slightly different on the Gemma from most other programming environments. For most programming, colors are described by the amount of red, green, and blue light to emit. These numbers are normally in the range 0 to 255. In Python, we list these as a tuple (red, green, blue), such as:</description>

      <description>Importing is the process of adding functions from additional libraries to support your program.
Imagine we wish to use the randint() function to choose a random number between 1 and 6, as though we were throwing a single six-sided die.
The randint() function is included in the random library, but there are three ways we can import it, and each has its attractions.
import    1 2 3 4  import random num = random.</description>

      <description>When defining a function, the pieces of information that the function takes to do its job are called parameters. For example, here:
def add(first, second): return first + second first and second are the parameters of the function add().
When calling a function, the values given to it are called arguments.</description>

      <description>See also Types in Unity.
Computers store all information as sequences of numbers, but different kinds of data are encoded in different ways. For example, whole numbers and decimal numbers are stored differently.
Some common data types you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter are:
 integers (int) Integers are whole numbers, and can be positive or negative. booleans (bool) Booleans are either true or false, and are used for logic and decision making. floating point numbers (float and double) Floating point numbers (commonly called floats) are for storing decimal numbers.</description>
